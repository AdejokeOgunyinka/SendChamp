# Test Instructions:   
- Setup a React app with Chakra-UI and RecoilJS 
- Replicate our Pricing Page. 

NB: Use the font from the website. The only state management to be used should be RecoilJS.


# Steps required to run this project
- run 'yarn dev' in your terminal

# Packages/Technologies used
- Vite (for bootstrapping my React-ts app)
- useQuery (for making an API call to the countries API that I used to populate the 2 dropdowns on the pricing page)
- Chakra UI (for React UI Components)
- Recoil JS (didn't really make use of this in the project, but I hooked it up within App.tsx)
- axios (used it hand in hand with useQuery for the API call)
- aos (for the animation onscroll)
